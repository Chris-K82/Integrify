    Subject: GIT Commands
    DESC: I have reviewed Peter's submission as well as the linked website for GIT command training. A synopsis of that review is what follows.
```

Today's homework :
Assessing another student's GIT submission.
Your goal is to write a small report outlining :
1. Did that particular submission cover all needed commands? 
2. If not, what commands were missing? 
3. Do the sequences in which the commands have been written make sense? (try it out in your GIT console) 
4. What are the differences between your submission and that particular submission you are reviewing? 
5. If you have found some other useful commands that were missing in the tutorial file, what were these? 
IN ADDITION:
6. Try out the Javascript based web tool  https://learngitbranching.js.org/ to learn more about branching branching and write down your experience of using it - - does it help you to understand? 
Upload your report to Git in.md format. 
The name of the file should be :original_author_name_your_name.
Submission format has to be : .md (MARKDOWN). Learn how to write a Markdown File on https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/
OUTPUT : Send me the Markdown report file.
AFTER YOU HAVE COMPLETED this assignment:
This Friday, I will randomly ask 5 students to present on the blackboard what they have learned about Basic Python, GIT and Linux commands so learn also those.

Peter's Git HW Review by Chris Kraus

1. Peter demonstrated an entry-level git knowledge base with the curiosity and drive to research and learn more GIT commands/features. This, in my opinion, is what it takes to become a great scientist/engineer. Without that drive to solve or learn, all hope is lost.
2. Not Applicable
3. Peter followed the basic git workflow process, no errors.
4. My submission included some additional global GIT user configurations aimed at simplifying the git workflow process as well as establishing set workflow templates.
5. As previously mentioned, I used the GIT config commands to set up GIT to be more user-friendly and simpler to utilize.
6. I like the interactive learning environment provided by the website at the link above. It also helped to solidify the methodology through repetitive git exercises covering everything through rebasing, merging, etc.
